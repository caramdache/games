CoreData relationship sample
=============================

This sample demonstrate how to create CoreData relationships in RubyMotion without using XCode and XCode data models. The sample is loosely based on https://github.com/HipByte/RubyMotionSamples/tree/master/Locations, but extents Locations as follows:

- relationships are demonstrated and not just attributes
- additional properties can be set: optional, indexed, transient
- attributes and relationships are specified declaratively and on a per object basis
- store.rb is mostly independent from the objects
- some CoreData helper/extension classes are provided in lib/
- both table views with and without sections are demonstrated

Use
===

To-many relationships are declared as follows:
- minCount = 0
- maxCount = NSIntegerMax



Caveats
=======

The NSBooleanAttributeType is supported, but the RubyMotion compiler (v1.9) currently handles the attribute as an integer. Thus Ruby boolean operators like ! cannot be used directly.

When accessing a to-many relationship, you should not expect a standard Ruby array. Instead, the collection will likely be a CoreData fault when first accessed, for example _NSFaultingMutableOrderedSet. You should use Obj-C collection methods instead, like count, objectAtIndex or allObjects. CoreData will transparently mutate the fault into a real collection, whose objects you can then handle in Ruby.

It looks like NSAttributeDescription attributes names cannot end with a digit currently. For example, 'player2' is not supported.

RubyMotion does not currently support varargs methods currently (v1.9), so you should use:
    NSPredicate.predicateWithFormat('player = %@', argumentArray:[player])
instead of:
    NSPredicate.predicateWithFormat('player = %@', player)
This bug will likely be fixed soon.
